## SeamlessMC
### Plugins and tools to enchance gameplay on Spigot servers
### I was working on SeamlessMC as a server itself, as I no longer have the time I will be maintaing and realeasing the plugins themselves!
### Note: these projects have been abondoned for years some will be fully functional some will not with the current Spigot, Discord, Packet, or other plugin(s) APIs.
### I have plans to update and modernize all SeamlessMC plugins to Spigot 1.21.1 by the end of the 2024
